## Emitted when the state finishes and wants to transition to another state.
signal finished(next_state_path: String, data: Dictionary)

## Called by the state machine when receiving unhandled input events.
func handle_input(event: InputEvent) -> void:
	pass

## Called by the state machine on the engine's main loop tick.
func update(delta: float) -> void:
	pass

## Called by the state machine on the engine's physics update tick.
func physics_update(delta: float) -> void:
